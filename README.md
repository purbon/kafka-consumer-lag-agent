# A Consumer Lag agent for Apache Kafka

This repository is an on-going example on creating a custom monitoring agent for Apache Kafka.

It is known in the Apache Kafka community, but as well in other streaming cases that monitoring
the consumer lag is a very important metric to obtain. However it is not that easy to get in Apache Kafka, without 
adding an external agent.

This repo shows, how to add a custom monitoring agent where the user can get custom JMX metrics in a similar
fashion as the other Kafka metrics.

*NOTE*: This is a living repo, work in progress for now.

All contributions as very welcome!
